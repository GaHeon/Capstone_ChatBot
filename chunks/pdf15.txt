Maintaining things is a natural part of our lives. We take our cars for oil changes, brush
our teeth for dental health, and tidy up our homes occasionally. The act of maintenance
is so ingrained in our daily lives that we don’t give it much thought. But imagine what
could happen if we stopped maintaining these things? Our cars might break down and
leave us stranded, our teeth might fall out, and our homes could become a mess.
Maintenance is essential, and this is especially true in a healthcare setting. Providers are
required to maintain their facilities, supplies, and equipment to ensure an acceptable
level of safety and quality for patients and meet industry standards for inspection. But

level of safety and quality for patients and meet industry standards for inspection. But
what are these levels and industry standards, and how difficult are they to maintain?
Join us as we explore the importance of healthcare equipment maintenance logs and
their critical role in maintaining high patient care and safety standards.

In any medical or healthcare facility, the equipment is costly, most likely needing
updating, and its maintenance is sporadic at best. Here’s what you need to know about
medical equipment repair and maintenance to understand and relay the value of
maintenance logs to your staff.
Preventive and Corrective Maintenance
The two types of medical equipment maintenance are preventive maintenance (PM)
and corrective maintenance (CM).
Preventive maintenance involves scheduled inspections, testing, and maintenance of
medical equipment to prevent equipment failures or malfunctions. PM is usually
performed according to the manufacturer’s recommended maintenance schedule to
ensure equipment functions safely and effectively. PM may include cleaning,
calibration, and routine replacement of worn or damaged parts. PM helps reduce the
risk of equipment failure and downtime, improving patient safety and reducing costs
associated with repairs and replacements.

associated with repairs and replacements.
Corrective maintenance is repairing equipment after it has failed or malfunctioned.
CM is usually performed as needed and may involve troubleshooting, repairing, or
replacing parts to restore the equipment to its proper functioning. CM is reactive and
often more expensive than PM, but it is necessary to ensure that equipment
functions correctly when PM is insufficient or when unexpected failures occur.
The Cost of Medical Equipment Maintenance
The costs vary widely across the healthcare industry depending on the type, age, and
complexity of the equipment, as well as the frequency and nature of maintenance
required.
Medical equipment maintenance costs are a significant consideration for healthcare
organizations, and effective management of these costs is critical for providing quality
patient care while maintaining financial sustainability. That’s why adding an equipment

patient care while maintaining financial sustainability. That’s why adding an equipment
maintenance log to your compliance program could benefit your organization.
Why You Need a Healthcare Equipment
Maintenance Log
Equipment maintenance logs are vital records documenting the maintenance history of
medical devices and equipment used in healthcare facilities. These logs describe the
date of service, work completed, and who performed the service. By maintaining
accurate and complete records, healthcare organizations can demonstrate their
commitment to patient safety and quality care and avoid potential penalties and fines
associated with non-compliance.

Compliance With Federal Regulations
Medical equipment is subject to various regulations and standards, such as those from
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), and the Joint Commission. However, these organizations have
all adopted the CMS guidelines. These regulations require healthcare facilities to
maintain accurate maintenance records for their equipment. By keeping maintenance
logs, healthcare facilities can demonstrate compliance with these regulations in case of
an audit or inspection.
Facilities must also maintain records of personnel qualifications, all equipment
maintenance policies, procedures, and programs, as well as specific equipment
maintenance inventories, activities, and schedules. Finally, facilities must ensure they
have documentation of equipment failures, including whether there was harm to an
individual.

What To Include in Your Healthcare Equipment
Maintenance Log?
The log should capture specific, detailed information to ensure the proper maintenance
and repair of the equipment. Here are some examples of the types of data that you’ll
need:
Equipment identification, including the equipment’s make, model, and serial number
Record all maintenance activities performed on the equipment, including the date,
time, and type of maintenance performed
Equipment status, including any issues or problems and their solutions
The names of the individuals who performed the maintenance activities
Any parts or supplies used during maintenance activities
Calibration data, the method used, and its results
Test results, measurements, or readings and their results
Feedback received from equipment users regarding the performance or any issues
Write down any identified risks and the activities taken to mitigate those risks
By capturing this data in a medical equipment maintenance log, healthcare

By capturing this data in a medical equipment maintenance log, healthcare
organizations can ensure that their equipment is adequately maintained and repaired
and that the equipment is safe and effective for patient use. It also helps to identify any
potential issues or risks that may need to be addressed and provides a record of
maintenance activities for compliance and reporting purposes.
