Brachytherapy Quality Assurance
Brachytherapy requires a high degree of manual labor which, owing to steep dose gradients
and variable source strength, must be performed to high standards of precision. The majority of
brachytherapy medical errors are preventable with an appropriate quality assurance program.
AAPM TG-40 provides general guidance on brachytherapy quality control. This report states
that a precision of +/-15% is realistic for brachytherapy dosimetry and may be lower for complex
multiplane interstitial implants. Regulatory requirement for radiation safety are found in NRC 10
CFR. (https://oncologymedicalphysics.com/nrc-10-cfr/)
Data from IAEA Report No 17

Important QA Points
A vendor supplied source calibration may be accepted but must be verified to +/- 3%

--- Chunk 2 ---
A vendor supplied source calibration may be accepted but must be verified to +/- 3%
(batch) and +/-5% (individual deviation from mean)
At least 10% of a batch of sources should be assayed.
Source inventories must be maintained

--- Chunk 5 ---
Key Point: Well chambers typically exhibit a strong energy dependence in the brachytherapy
energy range. Therefore, it is important to calibrate the well chamber using the correct
source nuclide and source model as source construction impacts attenuation and energy
spectrum.
Quality Assurance for High Dose Rate Afterloaders
10 CFR Part 35 - Afterloader QA
Key Point: While the AAPM TG-40 provides guidelines for quality assurance of remote
afterloaders, most states require the quality assurance mandated in 10 CFR Part 35.
Full Calibration (10 CFR 35.633)
Full calibration is required prior to first afterloader
use, after source replacement, after significant
repair, and at least quarterly.

Source Change Quality Assurance
Source change is performed by a qualified field service engineer. Appropriate afterloader
preventative maintenance will also be performed during a source change. Quality assurance
focuses on assuring source strength and positional accuracy of the afterloader.
1. A source chance is typically performed every 3-4 months corresponding to a drop of
activity by 60-70% (3-4Ci assuming an initial activity of 10Ci).
2. Source will arrive in shielded shipping container and prior to source change and must be
stored in secure room until.
Source packaging must be inspected for damage and surveyed via wipe test upon
receipt.

--- Chunk 9 ---
Source packaging must be inspected for damage and surveyed via wipe test upon
receipt.
3. On the day of source exchange, the service engineer will safely remove the old source
and insert the new source.
4. Physicist performs quality assurance after source change.
Verify appropriate source received compared with documentation.
Verify source activity using calibrated well-type ionization chamber.
Verify source length and positioning.
Update treatment planning system with source activity (around 10Ci).

Applicators
The following tests are recommended by AAPM
TG-41 for the acceptance testing of an HDR
applicator
Key point: The primary source of
potential error in a transfer
tube/applicator system would be a
systematic positioning error.
1. Guide tube integrity
2. Applicator integrity
3. Source and dummy positioning
This can be measured using gafchromic
film
4. Accurate movement of source through the
applicator producing expected dose
distributions
This can be measured using gafchromic
film
5. Applicator attenuation (if dose calculation will
be attenuation corrected)
