Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance
Introduction
1. Medical equipment contributes to the quality of healthcare services on several levels. They play a key role 
in the diagnosis, the treatment, and the rehabilitation of the medical impairment and diseases. Equipment 
maintenance includes a set of activities to keep equipment in optimum working condition and consists 
of periodic inspection, preventive maintenance, calibration and breakdown maintenance. The equipment 
maintenance objective is to ensure maximum availability with minimum downtime, maximum reliability, 
extend the useful life of equipment, prevention of wastage of consumables & spares and maximize return on 
investment. 
2. Modern day hospitals are equipment heavy organizations as equipment is an integral part of health technology

--- Chunk 7 ---
management and without equipment good patient care is impossible. There is an increasing reliance by the 
medical community on sophisticated equipment & technology for diagnostic, monitoring and therapeutic 
activities. Non-functional equipment is a major contributing factor for wasteful expenditure in health 
facilities. Optimum utilization of equipment requires that the equipment remains in functional order for 
most of its life. Keeping medical equipment safe and effective will require timely preventive maintenance, 
calibration and breakdown maintenance services carried out by trained & competent people. 
3. Few States have adopted good equipment inventory management using in-house online systems and forming 
facility level Hospital Equipment Management Committee to undertake equipment audit and identify 
procurement need, hold condemnation board for obsolete & dysfunctional equipment. Such best practices

--- Chunk 8 ---
adopted by a few states should be replicated in all the states for effective biomedical equipment inventory 
management. The best practices have been included in the ibid guidelines which will help to ensure that 
equipment being used at the public health facilities, is:
 (a) Suitable for its intended purpose
 (b) Properly understood by appropriately trained users
 (c) Maintained in a safe and reliable condition
 4.  A good Equipment management Program demands a multidisciplinary equipment management committee 
at the core of the program which can provide a participatory mechanism for prudent, need based, purchases, 
planned maintenance with minimum downtime and optimal utilization with maximum returns. 
Levels of equipment maintenance
5. The levels of equipment maintenance are:
 (a) By operator (day-to-day maintenance)
 (b) By in-house biomedical engineer
 (c) By OEM trained service engineer or trained BME
National biomedical equipment management and maintenance 
programme

--- Chunk 9 ---
National biomedical equipment management and maintenance 
programme
6. The National Biomedical Equipment Management & Maintenance Programme (BMMP) is in operation since 
2015. Financial support is provided under National Health Mission to the states/UTs under the programme for 
equipment maintenance activities and its upkeep, through annual Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs). 
The services are offered both in the PPP mode or through in-house mode as per the state’s requirement.

--- Chunk 10 ---
8 | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance, Calibration & Testing | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance
7. The program envisages to provide support by outsourcing medical equipment maintenance in the PPP mode, 
to improve the functionality and life of equipment, simultaneously improving healthcare services in public 
health facilities by reducing the cost of care and improving the quality of care. The program is operational in 
30 States and UTs through Outsourcing mode as well as in-house mode. The outsourcing model of service 
delivery is as per the NHM guidelines on National Biomedical Equipment Management and Maintenance 
Program. The in–house mode of service delivery is based on maintenance through Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs) by engaging through Comprehensive Maintenance Contract (CMC) or Annual 
Maintenance Contract (AMC). 
8. However, in the both the modes of operation, availability of Biomedical Engineer & Technician at the

--- Chunk 11 ---
district & facility level is essential for the successful outcome of the Biomedical Equipment Management & 
maintenance programme. IPHS-2022 has also recommended a post for Biomedical Engineer in the District 
Hospitals to oversee equipment maintenance as per AMC at public health facilities within the district. The 
engineer will also be responsible for training of technicians on equipment handling and ensuring calibration 
of equipment.
Life cycle of medical equipment
9. The delivery of the best healthcare services depends heavily on reliable medical equipment, weather for 
life support, for diagnosis, for patient monitoring or for the delivery of therapies or teaching and research 
purposes. The risks associated with the use of medical equipment can only be controlled by managing the 
whole life cycle of the equipment.

--- Chunk 12 ---
Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance, Calibration & Testing | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance | 9
Categorization of medical equipment
10. There is a need to categorize the equipment for mapping the asset base and prioritizing the maintenance 
activities. One of the suggested methods for categorization of equipment is given below :
Sl. No. Category of Equipment Criteria for Categorization
(a) Sophisticated Electro Medical 
Equipment
Electro Medical equipment which are costly & sophisticated 
supplied by OEM and spares easily not available in the local 
market. 
(b) Electro Medical Equipment ‘Plug & Play’ medical equipment which do not require OEM 
intervention and spares available in the local market and 
the complaints can be resolved by the in-house Biomedical 
engineer or through the service provider
(c) Non-Electro Medical equipment Medical Equipment which does not require electricity for 
operation and are mechanical in nature and less chances for

--- Chunk 13 ---
operation and are mechanical in nature and less chances for 
breakdown. Complaints can be resolved or certified regarding 
its dysfunctional by the in-house Biomedical Engineer/ Service 
provider.
11. The summary of the number of equipment categorized as per healthcare facility level based on criticality and 
Electromedical (Plug & Play) characteristic, as per IPHS-2022 is given below:
Facility Level Critical Non-Critical Electromedical Non-
Electromedical
SC-HWC Nil 13 Nil 13
PHC-HWC 5 40 17 28
CHC 21 85 69 37
DH 31 112 97 46
12. The list of equipment asset categorization at each level of healthcare as per IPHS-2022 is placed as Annexure 
‘C’ to this document. The List of critical lifesaving medical equipment (Sophisticated Electromedical) 
approved by MoHFW (Annexure ‘B’) is reproduced below :

Hospital equipment management committee (HEMC)
13. For effective monitoring and supervision of the quality of services being provided by the service provider in 
PPP mode, a Hospital Equipment Management Committee is considered essential. The suggested composition 
would be as follows:
 (a) MS Hospital/ AMS or MO IC health facility
 (b) Head or Nominated members from clinical specialties
 (c) Biomedical Engineer 
 (d) Store in Charge
 (e)  Purchase Officer/ Finance Officer
 (f) Nursing Superintendent
14. The HEMC should hold a meeting, at least once in a quarter to discuss regrading the equipment functionality 
and its maintenance. The HEMC will also undertake the following activities:
 (a) Receive proposals from the respective departments
 (b) Evaluation of the proposals received from the department for procurement/induction of new equipment

--- Chunk 16 ---
and the justification provided after need analysis and cost-benefit analysis. 
 (c) Receipt, Installation & Commissioning of new equipment at the hospital.
 (d) Training of the user staff in operation & maintenance of the equipment
 (e) Preparation of Equipment Master Maintenance Plan consisting of the scheduled preventive maintenance 
& calibration of the equipment
 (f) Undertake review of equipment inventory (Equipment census) available and their utilization once in a 
year. List out functional, dysfunctional & repairable or BER equipment.
 (g) Carry out equipment audit and review the asset base with addition of new equipment and its valuation, 
deletion of BER/Condemned equipment from the asset base.
 (h) Monitoring the activities of the maintenance service provider (in PPP), complaint management, 
equipment downtime, and ensuring preventive maintenance & calibration are carried out as per the 
OEM recommendations.

--- Chunk 17 ---
OEM recommendations.
 (i) Monitor weeding out of the old/obsolete equipment declared beyond economic repairs and recommend 
proposal for condemnation to the SHS/Md NHM. 
 (j) Record achievement of the Key deliverables approved for the BMMP at the facility and forward a copy 
to the SHS/SNO BMMP/MD NHM office for collation and inclusion in the annual PIPs.
 (k) The committee shall undertake analysis of the records pertaining to equipment breakdown and preventive 
maintenance logs. They shall also assess the usage and performance of the equipment. The committee 
shall also suggest measures to optimally utilize the equipment for quality health services.  
Equipment audit
15. Equipment audit is a periodic evaluation system to measure the quality of performance of the medical 
equipment. The focus of the equipment audit should be to assess the current status of the medical equipment, 
carry out equipment census, analyze the records of breakdown, preventive maintenance, service engineer

--- Chunk 18 ---
report, record the feedback from user experience in the usage and performance of the equipment, electrical 
reasons, if any etc. The equipment audit should clearly bring out the reason for dysfunctional equipment 
which could be as follows:

--- Chunk 19 ---
Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance, Calibration & Testing | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance | 11
 (a) Want of minor repairs
 (b) Lack of Preventive maintenance
 (c) Lack of corrective maintenance
 (d) Lack of essential spares
 (e) Electrical faults
 (f) Unfavorable equipment conditions
 (g) Mishandling of equipment by untrained and unskilled manpower
 (h) Purchase of equipment without justifiable demand etc
 (i) False reporting, willful damage and overuse than rated.
Key deliverables under BMMP for PIPs
16. The key performance indicators for the National Biomedical Equipment Management & Maintenance 
Programme are as follows:
 (a) Equipment CAMC/AMC (in Percentage) : Percentage of equipment covered under comprehensive 
maintenance contract/Annual maintenance contract.
 (b) Numerator : Total No. of equipment covered under warranty/CAMC/AMC Denominator : Total No. 
of equipment held in the inventory.

--- Chunk 20 ---
of equipment held in the inventory. 
  Equipment upkeep time (in Percentage) : Percentage of equipment uptime at each level of Public 
Health facility as per BMMP guidelines i.e. (PHC-80%, CHC-90% and DH-95%)
  Numerator : Total No. of equipment found functional at the facility during census
  Denominator : Total No. of equipment held in the inventory (asset base) at the facility.
Inventory and documentation
17. Inventory management is a key component of equipment management. It provides information to support 
various aspects of medical equipment. Online inventory management is an ideal option developed in-house 
or customized by the state. Online inventory helps in analytics and good record keeping. Further, States 
should also ensure that the admin control of the IT dashboard and safe custody of the server holding BMMP 
data is secured with the State Health Society/NHM office, in the case of PPP service provider.

--- Chunk 21 ---
data is secured with the State Health Society/NHM office, in the case of PPP service provider. 
18. States where the BMMP is operational, the service provider has an IT dashboard for recording complaints and 
inventory management. However, for the states where the BMMP is operational in-house, online inventory 
management & maintenance is always beneficial and should be adopted. Centralized equipment inventory 
management application like eUPKARAN (equipment management & maintenance system) is more efficient 
than the traditional paper-pen system for effective BMMP service delivery. The format for the Equipment 
Logbook and inventory master record is given in Annexure ‘E’ and ‘F’ respectively.    
Types of maintenance
19.  Maintenance of equipment is classified as :
 (a) Preventive or scheduled maintenance : This is the maintenance carried out at Predetermined intervals 
or according to the manufacturer’s recommendation to reduce the probability of equipment failure. The

--- Chunk 22 ---
major advantage of the preventive maintenance is reduction in equipment downtime, ensures safety of 
equipment, extended useful life of equipment, availability during emergency.

--- Chunk 23 ---
12 | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance, Calibration & Testing | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance
XX Preventive maintenance of all the equipment held at the facility whether in use or not shall be done 
periodically as per the recommendation of manufacturer/supplier.; so that functioning status of the 
equipment is known, and the equipment is readily available whenever required. 
XX In critical areas like casualty, ICU, OT daily inspection of the life saving critical equipment is 
required and standby active unit should be kept ready so that patient do not suffer in case of 
equipment failure. BMMP guidelines has the provision for the service provider to supply alternate 
machine till the equipment downtime for ensuring patient safety and continuity in patient care. 
XX Availability of good quality spares/ consumables and accessories is essential and helps in prolonging 
the useful life of equipment.

--- Chunk 24 ---
the useful life of equipment.
 (b) Breakdown or Corrective Maintenance :  This is the maintenance carried out after fault recognition 
and is intended to put equipment into a state in which it can perform a required function. It is important 
to analyze the reason for the breakdown/shut down and ensure early rectification. The user should 
record details of the breakdown/defect/fault and attach label to the faulty equipment so that it is not used 
by other staff. The user should immediately contact the service engineer/service provider and log his 
complaint using Toll Free number provided by service provider/OEM for call resolution.
20.  The service provider/OEM carrying out the repairs should give a guarantee/ warranty certificate stating that 
the equipment serviced by them will render trouble free service for a defined period. In case the equipment 
breakdowns within the warranty period, it should be repaired free of cost.
Maintenance contract

--- Chunk 25 ---
breakdowns within the warranty period, it should be repaired free of cost.
Maintenance contract
21.  The process for fresh maintenance contract (AMC/CMC/Warranty) of the equipment should be initiated 3 
(three) months in advance, before the expiry of the warranty/CAMC/AMC period. The necessary concurrence 
from the finance department of the institution required for the renewal of the contract/fresh contract shall be 
taken well in advance so that equipment remains functional, and downtime is minimized.

Fixed charges usually embedded 
in the procurement cost
22. The specialized and lifesaving critical equipment will require comprehensive maintenance contract (CMC) 
with all the spares included. The procurement of the equipment should preferably be done with 02 years 
warranty and 08 years CMC. The rates approved for post warranty CMC, will be as per the RFP terms & 
conditions for the the duration of the contract period and the rate cannot be modified by the vendor, unless 
there is a clause to do so.

--- Chunk 27 ---
Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance, Calibration & Testing | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance | 13
Warranty management
23.  Warranty management requires good record keeping and timely renewals. National Biomedical Equipment 
Management & Maintenance Programme has the provision for the District Biomedical Engineer to monitor 
the equipment asset base. The asset register must be updated periodically with the arrival of any new 
equipment and deletion of equipment recommended BER/condemnation. Penalty provisions in the service 
level agreement must be invoked for non-compliance by the service provider/OEM. 
Commissioning and acceptance of the equipment
24. The procurement agency/competent authority should ensure installation and commissioning of the equipment 
by the manufacturer/supplier at the health facility. The date of the installation should be communicated in 
advance to the health facility. Requisite power connections, earthing, serviceability of the electrical line,

--- Chunk 28 ---
air-conditioning equipment, online voltage regulator/stabilizer etc should be ensured before installation. 
The process should be monitored by in-house technical staff/user so that any important ‘Dos & DON’T’s’ 
can be recorded in the maintenance/equipment history log register. The occasion also provides an excellent 
opportunity for the in-house staff to gain familiarity with the new equipment and get trained in its operation. 
Monitoring of use and performance
25. It is important that user should safely use the equipment and also monitors the performance of the equipment. 
User should immediately register complaint through the TOLL- FREE number provided by the service 
provider/OEM and monitor the real time breakdown time. The user should maintain a record of all such 
breakdown and the reason attributed for the same to take future preventive action. The user should undertake

--- Chunk 29 ---
visual inspection, power-on/off & performance test, report errors due to equipment failure (calibration) etc. 
These tasks must be carried out by the user as per the manufacturer’s instructions and documented in the 
equipment logbook. Any discrepancy found, should be brought into notice of the head of department/HEMC 
for necessary corrective action. 
Equipment life
26. The physical life of equipment is identified as service life, which is the time period till the equipment can no 
longer be operated. This is greatly impacted by the repair & maintenance attention that the machine has been 
provided over its lifespan. Equipment that has not been given adequate maintenance throughout its lifespan 
will deteriorate at a faster rate than a machine that was given substantial preventive maintenance. 
27. Economic life is based on decreasing ownership costs with the increase in operating costs. The time period

--- Chunk 30 ---
that these costs are equivalent is called the economic life. The useful life of a medical equipment is not the 
same as actual life of an asset. A piece of equipment may last far longer than its estimated useful life but will 
need higher maintenance resources. In addition, an equipment may become obsolete or require major repairs 
but still be technically functional but may be a more of liability than a benefit as it may require frequent 
repair work. In such case when spares are not available in the open market then sustenance becomes less cost 
effective and should be recommended for condemnation.
Asset management
28. Asset management provide the means through which likely future equipment needs are identified, criteria 
for prioritising needs are set and informed decisions on spending priorities are made. Decisions based on 
asset management plans should lead to greater efficiency in the use of medical equipment. A key output from

--- Chunk 31 ---
the plan should be a prioritised equipment procurement program, regularly updated, that addresses the most 
serious and urgent needs of hospitals.

--- Chunk 32 ---
14 | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance, Calibration & Testing | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance
29. The strategies for hospital medical equipment procurement should include scientific need or gap assessment, 
value based procurement, timely maintenance, repairs, optimum utilization, and timely replacement. 
Equipment availability, functionality, effective, efficient utility assessment are the bedrock of any equipment 
management program. Care should be taken to avoid supplier induced demands, indiscriminate use, 
duplication, and underutilisation of any equipment. 
Approach to medical equipment valuation
30. Depreciation represents the decline in value of a piece of equipment due to age, wear, deterioration & 
obsolescence. Depreciation can result from either physical deterioration occurring from wear & tear of the 
machine or due to economic decline or obsolescence occurring over the passage of time. There are two 
common techniques for calculating depreciation.

--- Chunk 33 ---
common techniques for calculating depreciation.
 (a) Straight Line Method
 (b) Written down Value (WDV) Method
Straight line method
31. Straight-line method also known as constant charge method used for charging depreciation in which 
depreciation is charged on annual basis. The depreciation charged in this way remains constant throughout 
the useful life of the asset. The depreciation is calculated by dividing a fixed asset’s depreciable base by its 
useful life. The depreciable base is the difference between an asset’s all-in costs and the estimated salvage 
value at the end of its useful life. With the straight-line depreciation method, the value of an asset is reduced 
uniformly over each period until it reaches its salvage value.
 * Residual Value = Expected re-sale value as scrap beyond equipment useful life
Illustration : straight line depreciation method
 Public Health Facility purchases an Ultrasound machine for INR 10,00,000 with an estimated expected

--- Chunk 34 ---
residual value of INR 10000 after a useful life of 10 years. 
 The straight-line depreciation for the machine would be calculated as follows :
Calculate annual depreciation expense
 (INR 10,00,000 – 10,000) / 10 years = INR 99,000 depreciation amount per year.
 Therefore, over the useful life of the asset, the value would depreciate to its salvage value.
Year Book Value (Beginning of the 
FY) in INR
Depreciation Value in INR Book Value in INR (Close of 
the FY)
1. 10,00,000 99,000 901000

5. 604000 99000 505000
6. 505000 99000 406000
7. 406000 99000 307000

8. 307000 99000 208000
9. 208000 99000 109000
10. 109000 99000 10000
Written Down Value (WDV) method
32. WDV method is the most common used method of depreciation. In this method a fixed depreciation rate is 
charged on the book value of asset and book value is decreased each year by subtracting the depreciation 
amount as calculated. This method is also called reducing balance method. In the WDV method, the amount 
of depreciation goes on decreasing with time. This method is considered as the most logical method of 
depreciation and good for high value equipment where the useful life is difficult to predict.
33. For Eg- Asset is purchased at INR 1,00,000 and depreciation rate is 10% then first year depreciation is INR 
10,000 (10% of INR 1,00,000), second year depreciation is INR 9,000 (10% of 90,000 [1,00,000 – 10,000])

--- Chunk 36 ---
and third year depreciation is INR 8100 (10% of INR 81,000 [90,000 – 9,000]).
Year Book Value (Beginning of 
the FY) in INR
Depreciation Value (10% 
of cost) in INR
Book Value in INR (Close 
of the FY)
After First Year 1,00,000 10000 90,000
2 90,000 9000 81000
3 81000 8100 72900
4 72900 7290 65610
5 65610 6561 59049
6 59049 5904 53145
7 53145 5314 47831
8 47831 4783 43048
9 43048 4304 38744
10 38744 3874 34870
34. In view of the above, it is prudent to take the average useful life span of medical equipment as 10 years. 
However, if well maintained medical equipment may continue to be used for a longer time. Old medical 
equipment which has serviced beyond its useful life is likely to be technologically obsolete and difficult to 
support as spare availability in the market is a big challenge. Several high med medical equipment are quite 
sturdy e.g., CT & MRI machine which do not necessarily face functional obsolescence, as fast as others.

--- Chunk 37 ---
35.  For historical equipment (Equipment has outlived its useful life i.e., more than 15 years except high end 
equipment), the book value calculated at the close of FY using the WDV method would be the asset value 
and to be taken for asset calculation purpose. In few instances when the cost of the historical equipment or 
the date of installation is not known and records supporting the same are not available in the health facility, 
a notional value mutually agreed upon by the state health authority and the service provider, not exceeding 
the valuation calculated by the WDV method using the discovered cost of the equipment as on the date and 
the probable age of the equipment may be taken for  asset valuation purpose. 
36. Statutory Requirements :
 (a) In India Radiology equipment need to be registered with and have operating license from AERB. AERB 
no longer permits usage of radiology equipment that is older than 10 years. Existing equipment should

--- Chunk 38 ---
have de-commissioning approval from AERB to be provided approval for purchase and re-installation. 
Any equipment which currently does not have AERB license simply cannot be re-installed, so it has

--- Chunk 39 ---
16 | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance, Calibration & Testing | Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance
only scrap value. AERB could shut down operations of any unit not in compliance with its radiation 
safety requirements.
 (b) All Ultrasound machines must have PC-PNDT license before purchase and NOC is required from local 
Health authorities to sell and transfer ultrasound machine.
37. The adoption of effective maintenance practices by hospitals is essential if medical equipment is to function as 
intended. It is also important to prevent equipment breakdowns that could interrupt the delivery of healthcare 
services or be potentially harmful to patients or staff. To achieve a good inventory control, the following is 
recommended :
XX Prepare ‘Asset Management Plan’ with yearly forecasts of funding requirements for the medical 
equipment. 
XX Develop a ‘Single Master Asset Register’, using standard classifications to describe the medical

--- Chunk 40 ---
equipment and specified details of the equipment, as per the Guidelines given in National BMMP. 
XX Develop and use guidelines which reflect industry best practice to periodically assess the life expectancy 
of the equipment.
XX Regularly determine the condition of the medical equipment using a standardized assessment system.
XX Undertake yearly equipment census and audit for categorizing the inventory as functional, 
dysfunctional – needs repair, dysfunctional – beyond economical repair and prepare a list of equipment 
for condemnation and hold the condemnation board as per the National Biomedical Equipment 
Management & maintenance programme.
38.  Given the sophistication of modern medical equipment, maintenance practices can be very complex, 
requiring expertise in a broad range of specialities such as electronics, computers, mechanical systems, 
pneumatics, chemicals and optical systems. Generally, hospitals use a combination of in-house maintenance

--- Chunk 41 ---
staff (biomedical or engineering departments) and external maintenance services, such as those provided by 
the equipment supplier, or a third-party provider.
39. For major items of equipment, virtually all maintenance is carried out under comprehensive service contracts. 
The service is provided by either the vendor or by multi- vendor service companies. The in-house biomedical 
engineering department generally provide a first-response service, checking the equipment for simple faults 
before calling the contractor, and at some hospitals they also monitor the service contracts.
40.  An important responsibility for asset managers is to ensure that maximum benefit is derived from their 
assets. Accordingly, asset managers need to be mindful where, for example, equipment is no longer effective 
in performing the activities required of it, it is in less than optimum condition, or demand for the services

--- Chunk 42 ---
it delivers or supports has reduced. Underutilised equipment should be identified and the reasons for this 
examined and, as far as possible, rectified.
Training and development
41. Proper training is critical for the safety of patients and the user. The user should be trained in operating the 
equipment safely, basic knowledge of possible faults, DO’s & DON’T’s, rectifying minor causes of failure 
and calibration requirement. 
Conclusion
42. A good equipment management program needs to be established at levels of healthcare, which is an essential 
requirement for patient safety and optimal use of the medical equipment. A proactive HEMC is the key to 
achieve good equipment maintenance program and functional equipment inventory.  For success of the 
program, however, it is essential that there should be good maintenance service, an efficient system of data 
collection, and documented policies & procedures governing every aspect of equipment management.

maintaining the quality of healthcare services, minimizing the risk of errors, and therefore enhancing patient 
health outcomes.
2. Calibrating instruments and processes are crucial for verifying their accuracy against established standards, 
ensuring consistent and error-reduced measurements that can be universally accepted. This procedure typically

--- Chunk 79 ---
includes comparing the instrument to either primary or secondary standards. In certain cases, calibrating a 
device against another one with a recognized level of accuracy may be sufficient.
Gaps in the Testing and Calibration of Biomedical Equipment
3. The calibration of biomedical equipment encounters many challenges and shortcomings, in India, which 
significantly affect the maintenance and management of the equipment.
4. Inaccurate or improperly calibrated equipment can compromise patient safety and reduce the efficacy of 
medical treatments, highlighting the critical need for improved calibration practices. The Key issues 
pertaining to the calibration of biomedical equipment include :
 4.1 Limited Technical Expertise among Service Providers :  Service providers frequently encounter 
difficulties in calibrating biomedical equipment due to lack of technical knowledge, insufficient training, 
and resource constraints.

--- Chunk 80 ---
and resource constraints.
 4.2  Inadequate Infrastructure :  Many healthcare facilities in India lack the required infrastructure for 
accurate calibration of medical equipment. This includes a shortage of dedicated calibration laboratories 
and skilled technical personnel.
 4.3 Shortage of Skilled Personnel :  There is a scarcity of skilled biomedical engineers and technicians 
capable of performing precise calibrations.
 4.4 Lack of Standardization : There is a lack of standardized guidelines and protocols for the calibration of 
biomedical equipment. This insufficiency of uniform standards can lead to inconsistencies in equipment 
performance.
 4.5 Limited Awareness :  Awareness among healthcare professionals & administrators regarding the 
importance of regular equipment calibration is limited, resulting in the neglect or postponement of 
calibration activities.

Guidelines on Equipment Maintenance, Calibration & Testing | Testing and Calibration of Biomedical Equipment | 33
 5.2 Quality Control : Testing and calibration helps ensure that medical devices are accurate and effective, 
and that they last a long time.
 5.3 Patient Safety : Regular testing and calibration can help prevent incorrect readings, misdiagnoses, and 
inappropriate treatment plans that could harm patients.
 5.4 Testing and Calibration can also help identify if a device is no longer suitable or has declined in quality, 
so that repairs or replacements can be made. For instance, the X-ray machine emitting radiation beyond 
the recommended norms by AERB.
Standards in Testing and Calibration of Biomedical Equipment
6. Standards are established sets of guidelines, criteria, or specifications that act as reference benchmarks to 
guarantee the accuracy, precision, reliability, and traceability of measurements, hence contributing to safety

--- Chunk 83 ---
and quality assurance. There are two types of standards :  written standard and measurement standard.
 6.1 Written standards are often established by global organizations such as International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO), International Electrochemical Commission (IEC), Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE), International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and others, 
providing a universally recognized and accepted framework.
 6.2 In India, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is an exclusive standardization body for development of Indian 
Standards (IS), as per the country’s requirement. BIS is a member of the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). 
 6.3 BIS has a dedicated division dealing with medical devices under the name “Medical Equipment and 
Hospital Planning Division (MHD).” At present, 20 committees are operating under MHD and have

--- Chunk 84 ---
Hospital Planning Division (MHD).” At present, 20 committees are operating under MHD and have 
published more than 1250 Indian Standards on Medical equipment (Product Standard). BIS standards 
can be accessed from BIS website, know your standards webpage (https://www.services.bis.gov.in/php/
BIS_2.0/bisconnect/knowyourstandards/Indian_standards/isdetails/).
 6.4 By adhering to written standards, organizations can uphold the quality of their products, comply with 
regulations, and maintain the reliability of measurements, ultimately building trust and confidence in 
what they offer. The most widely adopted written quality management standards are IS/ISO 9001:2015 
(Quality Management System), IS/ISO/IEC 17025:2017 (General requirements for the competence of 
testing and calibration laboratories) & IS/ISO/IEC 13485:2016 (Medical Devices- Quality Management 
Systems, Requirements for regulatory purpose).

--- Chunk 85 ---
Systems, Requirements for regulatory purpose).
 6.5 Quality management written standards mandate that laboratories showcase their adherence to a 
comprehensive quality system encompassing processes, documentation, and quality management. 
These labs are required to produce technically valid results, considering equipment, procedures, and 
personnel variables.
 6.6 Testing & calibration of medical devices should be based on established standards. For example, for 
testing and calibration of cardiac defibrillator should be based on IEC 60601-1:2012 (Medical electrical 
equipment: Part 1 General Requirements for basic safety and essential performance) & IEC 60601-2-4: 
2010 (Particular requirements for the basic safety and essential performance, Cardiac defibrillators).
 6.7 If there are no relevant Standard of any medical device that has been laid down by BIS or notified by 
MoHFW, device shall conform to the standard laid down by the ISO or IEC, or by any other pharmacopeial

--- Chunk 86 ---
standards. And in case of the standards which have not been specified by any of the options given 
above, then the device shall conform to the validated manufacturer’s standards.
